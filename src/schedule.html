            <h3>Attendance Awards</h3>
            <p>
                Starting in 2016, every time you attend an event, you will earn one virtual "ticket" good towards
                prizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once per quarter, we will pause the BG action to give away some prizes! All the "tickets"
                will be thrown into a virtual "basket" and prize winners drawn from the basket at random. The more
                events you attend, the better your chances to win a prize!
            <p>
                You must be present to win. We will announce each awards event several times to get the word out.
            </p>

        <h4 class="award">Quarterly Attendance Awards!</h4>
        <p>This meetup we will celebrate our first-ever quarterly attendance awards! We will be giving away prizes
            for attendance at SCBG events in Q1, 2016. See the banner to the right
            for more details. Halfway through, around 3pm,
            we'll break the action long enough to give away a portable board,
            donated by Bill Hathaway, one of our co-organizers and backgammon fanatic, to a player whose name will be
            drawn at random for this quarter's
            <span style="font-size: medium">Attendance Awards</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
            Rumor has it co-organizer Peter Swartwout will also be donating a bomber of beer! Good beer, of course.
            Bad beer doesn't come in bombers, come on.

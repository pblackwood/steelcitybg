            <h1>About the Club</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>Steel City Backgammon was created in 2016 to support backgammon enthusiasts of all skill levels. We exist
                because we love to play this centuries-old game with its incredible variety and excitement.</p>
            <p>While we do not yet have a charter, the following list is a start. We exist to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organize events for backgammon players to get together to play.</li>
                <li>Advance the game by providing education and learning opportunities such as lectures, position
                    discussions, and demonstrations to help players improve their games.
                </li>
                <li>Promote the game with this website, with our <a
                        href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Backgammon-Meetup/" target="_blank">Meetup Page</a>, and
                    in other ways.
                </li>
                <li>Promote the <a href="http://usbgf.org" target="_blank">United States Backgammon Federation</a>, the
                    national backgammon advocacy organization, and its many tournaments and activities.
                </li>
                <li>Sponsor competitive tournaments regularly for the enjoyment of our members.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>We intend to be governed by a board of directors, but that is not in place yet. Until that time, the club
                is directed by <a href="http://artisansoft.com" target="_blank">Peter Swartwout</a>, who is also the
                author of this website, and Bill Hathaway, two local backgammon aficionados.</p>
            <h2>Tournament Rules</h2>
            <p>All SCBG tournaments will adhere to the "legal moves" philosophy of play. A detailed description from the
                USBGF is at the link below, but in a nutshell it is just "good sportsmanship":
                Most illegal plays are mistakes, not intentional cheating, and in that spirit, if you notice your
                opponent making an illegal play, you must point it out and the player must correct it to be a legal play
                before the game continues. The same goes for you if you accidentally make an illegal move.
                Keep in mind that this rule applies whether or not the illegal play, or the corrected play, benefits you
                or your opponent in the game.</p>
            <p>Here is the <a href="http://usbgf.org/legal-moves/">Official USBGF Statement on Legal Moves</a>.</p>
            <p>We want our events to be fun and fair for everyone. In the unlikely event of a dispute that cannot be
                resolved by the players, the tournament director(s) can be brought in to give a ruling. The decision of
                the tournament director will be final.</p>
            <h2>Non-tournament rules</h2>
            <p>Attendees are free to enjoy any backgammon varieties or group-oriented games they choose. The club does
                not condone or organize any particular games
                except for the organized tournaments described above.</p>
            <p>Gambling on the outcomes of games is not permitted at SCBG events.</p>
            <p>The no gambling policy does not apply to entry fees for organized tournaments, which are considered games
                of skill. For some background, see <a
                        href="http://www.bkgm.com/articles/BackgammonTimes/LuckVsSkill-TrialOfTedBarr/" target="_blank">
                    The Trial (and Tribulations) of Oregon Promoter Ted Barr</a>,
                where the court ruled that backgammon is a game of skill, not chance, and therefore gambling statutes do
                not apply.
